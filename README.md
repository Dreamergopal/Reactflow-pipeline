# Reactflow‑Pipeline

A flow-chart-based data pipeline builder built with React and React Flow. It allows users to visually construct, arrange, and connect pipeline stages for streamlined data processing.

🧠 Note
Make sure the backend is running before using the frontend.

Use .env for secrets/config if needed.

Supports integration with databases, ML models, or external services.

# 🔧 Backend – FastAPI for Reactflow Pipeline

This is the backend API for the Reactflow Pipeline project. It handles processing, routing, and computation for the visual pipeline created in the frontend.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.9+**
- **FastAPI**
- **Uvicorn**
- (Optional: Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, etc.)

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. 📦 Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

2. 📥 Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. ▶️ Start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:
   uvicorn main:app --reload {Replace main with your Python file name (without .py) that defines app = FastAPI().}
   
4. 🚀 Server will run on:
    http://127.0.0.1:8000




##FRONTEND-INITIALIAZATION


## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive flow editor**: Drag‑and‑drop nodes, connect them with edges, delete/move elements.
- **Custom nodes & edges** powered by React Flow’s flexible API.
- **State management** with React hooks or Zustand/Redux – you choose.
- **Auto‑layout support** with Dagre, Elk, or similar libraries.
- **Export/reload** of pipeline graphs via JSON.

🎯 Usage
Add nodes: Use the node panel or drag from sidebar to canvas.

Connect nodes: Drag from a node’s handle to another node.

Edit nodes: Click to rename or configure node properties.

Delete elements: Select and press Delete.

Auto-layout: Rearrange nodes using layout algorithms.

Export/Import: Save pipelines to JSON and load them later.


---

🧩 Customization
Node Types: Define custom node styles/components using nodeTypes.

Edge Styles: Customize edges with edgeTypes or use <BaseEdge />.

Layout Engine: Integrate Dagre or Elk to auto-arrange nodes.

State Logic: Use Zustand, Redux or Context API as needed.

🧪 Demo & Examples
Sample flow: Input → Transform → Output

Each node can include custom config, logic, or data

Easily extendable to add validation, live preview, etc.
